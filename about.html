          <p>
            The objectives of the Institute are to promote equitable and sustainable development to overcome the inherited economical, and social 
           distortions from colonialism in South Africa and the continent as a whole, through:Worker-led knowledge production to shed light on the true experiences of the working class and centre workersâ€™ discourse on 
           their lived experiences. This will include quarterly reports, journal articles, manuals and other content in a format accessible to workers. Provide accessible strategic litigation to support workers facing barriers to accessing justice, including through resourcing litigation, information and capacity-building sessions, and solidarity activities associated with the litigation process. 
           Provide impactful advocacy and campaigns to shift policy and public discourse in favour or workers justice through workshops, 
           media engagement, mass mobilization and on-going online and in-person campaigns. 
          </p>

             Through targeted advocacy with both government and private sector stakeholders we seek to effect policy and legislative reform; 
               Through focused legal challenges we seek to create jurisprudence about the 
               rights we advocate for; and
               Through working and mobilising all workers affected, we seek to raise 
                awareness and behavioural changes that support our goals. <br> <br>
				By making changes in the policy and legislative framework, we believe we can 
                make the greatest impact in the lives of everyone in South Africa; 
                By working with grassroots organisations, union and the lived realities of poor 
                and marginalised workers, we ensure that those realities find expression and are 
                 addressed in the policy reform.
